          My paintings, in general, strive to present a deeply personal
          interpretation of the intricate relationship between human existence
          and the diverse wonders of the surrounding natural world. Whether it
          be the enchanting allure of the flora and fauna, with their often
          surreal and magical characteristics, or the very essence of being
          present in this world, I aim to capture the essence of our shared
          human experience, where our emotions and experiences find expression
          through creative action. My art is a testament to the peculiar
          spontaneity that resonates both within the natural world and the
          intricate connections we share as fellow beings. Each stroke of my
          brush is an authentic expression of life's beauty and ugliness, of
          distortion and grandeur, of the delicate balance between power and
          vulnerability, serenity and unrest.{" "}

          Born in 1989 in Satu Mare, Romania, I currently call Budapest my home,
          where I live and passionately create. My journey in art has been
          enriched by an academic pursuit that culminated in the attainment of a
          PhD Doctorate from Kolozsvári Művészeti Egyetem (University of Art and
          Design Cluj-Napoca) in 2022. My educational pursuit in art commenced
          with my Master's Degree in the Painting Department at Kolozsvári
          Művészeti Egyetem, spanning from 2011 to 2013, which was preceded by
          my Bachelor's Degree in the same department, completed between 2008
          and 2011.{" "}

          Grateful for the enriching experiences that shaped my artistic vision,
          I had the privilege of receiving scholarships that broadened my
          horizons. Among these, the Erasmus Exchange Program at Accademia di
          Belle Arti e Restauro, San Martino delle Scale, Palermo, Italy, during
          2012-2013, and another exchange at Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,
          Cuenca, Spain in 2010, allowed me to immerse myself in diverse
          artistic cultures.{" "}

          Throughout my artistic journey, I have been fortunate to showcase my
          work through various solo exhibitions, each one a milestone in my
          growth as an artist. In 2023, I presented my thought-provoking artwork
          titled 'OMEN' at the esteemed Art9 Galéria in Budapest. The year 2018
          marked a humbling opportunity to exhibit 'Sora,' a collection of my
          pieces, at Quadro Galéria in Kolozsvár. Additionally, I am grateful to
          have had my work featured at the renowned Saatchi Gallery in London
          during the Start Art fair in 2016. Prior to that, in 2014, I held a
          solo exhibition titled 'Hátsóudvar' at Quadro Galéria in Kolozsvár,
          which was warmly received by art enthusiasts. My journey in art began
          to blossom with an earlier solo exhibition in 2013 at the Mátyás-ház
          Galéria in Kolozsvár.{" "}
